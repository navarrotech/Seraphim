//! Posting a per-turn summary of the agent's reasoning back to the source issue.
//!
//! When [`Settings::post_thoughts_enabled`] is on, the orchestrator collects the
//! agent's "thoughts" during a turn (its extended-thinking blocks and prose),
//! then asks a separate, throwaway Claude invocation to condense them into a
//! short progress note and posts that as a single comment on the GitHub issue.
//! One comment per turn keeps the ticket readable instead of flooding it with
//! raw reasoning, and the summarization reuses the operator's subscription token.
