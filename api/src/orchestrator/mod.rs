//! The autonomous agent loop and the background sync/review loops.
//!
//! Three long-lived tasks run for the life of the process:
//! - **sync**: polls each enabled issue source and upserts issues into `Available`.
//! - **agent**: when idle and not paused, pulls the top of `To Do` and works it
//!   end to end through one resumable Claude Code conversation.
//! - **review**: merges `auto_squash_merge` PRs once their checks are green.
//!
//! The agent loop is inherently single-threaded: one task is awaited to
//! completion before the next is considered, so turns never overlap.
