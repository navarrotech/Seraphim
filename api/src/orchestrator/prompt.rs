    bespoke spacing.\n\
    - Match the surrounding components: before writing layout, look at the sibling \
    code and reuse the same primitives, token names, and spacing steps it already \
    uses. Consistency over novelty.\n\
    - The tokens and primitives live in each repo (its `tailwind.config`, theme/token \

    base URL/port, and the key routes (e.g. \"dev server: `npm run dev` on :5173; \
    check /, /login, /dashboard\"). If that is not recorded there, infer it (e.g. \
    the `dev` script in `package.json`) and add a short note to the repo's \
    `CLAUDE.md` so the next run has it.\n\
    - Start the dev server with test/dev data only (never production data) and open \
    the affected route(s) with the Playwright MCP browser tools (navigate, snapshot, \
    evaluate, screenshot), headless.\n\
    - Check layout (centering, spacing, overflow, stacking) using computed styles, \
    not screenshots: a reusable set of computed-style checks is documented at \
    `/usr/local/share/seraphim/visual-checks.md`. Read it, then run its checks via \
    the Playwright MCP `browser_evaluate` against the affected route(s). These \
    computed-style checks are your primary signal; take a screenshot only to confirm \
    the final result.\n\
    - Confirm it renders correctly at both mobile (375px) and desktop (1280px) \
    widths.\n\
    - To lock a confirmed-good screen against FUTURE regressions, a repo may opt into \
    committed Playwright visual-regression baselines (a standalone test in the repo's \
    own suite, not the MCP); the recipe is at \
    `/usr/local/share/seraphim/visual-regression.md`. This is opt-in per repo: only \
    establish or run baselines where the repo's `CLAUDE.md` says it is enabled, or the \
    task is to add it. Treat an unexpected screenshot diff as a regression to \
    investigate, never reflexively re-baseline to make the check green.\n\
    - If the repo has no runnable UI (a backend-only or non-web repo, no dev server, \
    or the browser tools are unavailable), SKIP this review: do not fail the task or \
    hold the PR for it, just note in your summary that you skipped visual review and \
