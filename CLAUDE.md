# Seraphim

> Project memory for agents working **on** Seraphim itself. Read this first.

## What it is

Seraphim is a **self-hosted autonomous developer agent**. It runs on one machine,
watches an issue board (GitHub and Jira), and works tickets like a real
developer: picks up the next issue, writes code inside a persistent Docker
workspace, opens a pull request, and follows per-repo review rules. A human
curates and orders the work on a kanban board; the agent just keeps going.

The core idea is a **long-lived, single-threaded Claude Code session**: the agent
carries context from issue to issue instead of starting cold each time, so the
human stops being the middle-man who hand-feeds prompts.

**Two planned deployments, one image, config-only differences:** a personal
laptop (JalapenoLabs, "squash-merge if checks pass") and a work laptop
(MooreslabAI, stricter human review). Behavior differs by DB settings + `.env` +
the mounted SSH keys, never by code.

## Final decisions (locked)

- **Backend:** Rust (Axum + tokio + sqlx + bollard + octocrab + eyre + mimalloc).
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit (Svelte 5 runes), SPA mode, `svelte-dnd-action` kanban.
- **DB:** Postgres 17.
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose is the primary deployment method.
- **Exposure:** Tailscale sidecar (`tailscale serve`); `scripts/{start,stop,restart}.sh` wrappers.
- **Hosts:** Windows 11 + Linux only (all services are Linux containers). No macOS.
- **Claude auth:** multiple credentials with priority rotation (issue #341), managed
  on Settings -> LLMs. Any mix of subscription OAuth logins, long-lived setup-tokens
  (`claude setup-token`), and Anthropic API keys; the agent runs on the highest
  priority one and rotates to the next when it hits its usage limit.
- **Secrets (Claude OAuth + GitHub tokens):** stored in the **database** (Settings UI), never in `.env`; injected into the agent's execs at runtime.
- **Agent trigger:** auto-pulls the top of **To Do** when idle (global pause switch exists).
- **Workspace model:** all enabled repos cloned flat under `/workspace`; Claude spawned at `/workspace` for cross-repo work.
- **`~/.claude` provisioning:** cloned from a **config repo** into the container (no host mount).
- **Repo auth:** SSH (mounted host `~/.ssh`) with HTTPS + `GH_TOKEN` fallback.
- **Ports (non-standard, host + internal):** API **27182**, UI **31415**.

## Architecture

Five Compose services (`docker-compose.yml`):

| Service | Stack | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | Postgres 17 | Board, issue cache, conversation log, config |
| `api` | Rust / Axum | The only orchestrator: sync, agent loop, REST + SSE, Docker control |
| `frontend` | SvelteKit | Kanban UI, live task stream, settings |
| `workspace` | Custom image | Long-lived agent sandbox (Claude Code + toolchain) |
| `tailscale` | Tailscale | Exposes the UI over the tailnet with HTTPS |
| `litellm` | LiteLLM proxy | **Opt-in** sidecar (`llm` profile): translates other LLMs to the Anthropic API (issue #342) |

**Control flow:** the `api` is the brain. The `workspace` is a powerful-but-dumb
sandbox; the API reaches in via `docker exec` (bollard) over the mounted host
Docker socket. Issue sync and PR/merge are done deterministically from Rust
(octocrab); the agent itself uses `git`/`gh` inside the workspace.

## Repo layout

```
docker-compose.yml      .env.example        README.md      CLAUDE.md
.github/workflows/ci.yml
api/        Rust backend (see below)
frontend/   SvelteKit UI
workspace/  Dockerfile + entrypoint.sh (the agent sandbox image)
tailscale/  serve.json
litellm/    config.yaml + README (opt-in LiteLLM proxy sidecar, issue #342)
scripts/    start.sh stop.sh restart.sh
```

### Backend (`api/`)
- `src/main.rs` — boot: config, DB connect+migrate, workspace handle, GitHub client, spawn loops, serve.
- `src/config.rs` — env config. `src/state.rs` — `AppState` (clone-cheap) + SSE broadcast bus.
- `src/db/` — `models.rs` (enums + `FromRow` structs), `queries.rs` (runtime sqlx), `mod.rs` (pool + migrate). Migrations in `api/migrations/`.
- `src/claude/` — `events.rs` (stream-json parser, unit-tested), `exec.rs` (the `docker exec` turn runner).
- `src/docker/` — `Workspace`: exec, restart, recreate (bollard).
- `src/tailscale/` — `Tailscale`: manages the `seraphim-tailscale` sidecar via the
  host Docker socket (exec `tailscale status/up/down/login` as root, container
  restart). Powers the Settings → Tailscale panel (`http/tailscale.rs`,
  `/api/v1/tailscale/{status,up,down,reauth,restart}`): the tailnet URL, hosting
  status, connect/disconnect, and a login URL when the node needs auth. Status
  JSON parsing is pure + unit-tested. Container name from `TAILSCALE_CONTAINER`.
  The compose service is always defined, but its entrypoint is guarded (issue
  #353): a blank `TS_AUTHKEY` (the "skip Tailscale" case) idles the container with
  `sleep infinity` instead of letting `containerboot` crash-loop against
  `restart: unless-stopped`; a set key hands off to the normal `containerboot`.
- `src/sources/` — `Source` enum (GitHub; Jira is a future variant), `github.rs`, `types.rs`.
- `src/git/` — PR detection, CI-green check, squash-merge (octocrab).
- `src/orchestrator/` — `mod.rs` (the loops), `provision.rs` (workspace provisioning), `prompt.rs`.
- `src/http/` — one file per resource + `sse.rs` + `data.rs` (export/import). Routes under `/api/v1`.

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
SvelteKit, **SPA** (`src/routes/+layout.ts` sets `ssr = false`), adapter-node.
`src/lib/api.ts` (ky client, one fn per endpoint), `src/lib/types.ts`, components
in `src/lib/components/`, pages in `src/routes/`. `src/hooks.server.ts` proxies
`/api/*` to the API in production; `vite.config.ts` proxies it in dev.

**Dev server / visual review:** `cd frontend && yarn dev` runs Vite on
`http://localhost:5173`, proxying `/api/*` to the API (`localhost:27182`), so the
API must be up. Key routes: `/` (kanban board), `/suggestions`, `/settings`,
`/task/<id>`. Checks: `yarn check` (svelte-check), `yarn test` (vitest), `yarn build`.

**Settings IA (issue #344):** a Stripe-style landing grid at `/settings`
(`routes/settings/+page.svelte`) links to one dedicated page per category at
`/settings/[section]`. The grid and each page header are driven by a single
registry (`src/lib/settings/sections.ts`, `SETTINGS_GROUPS` + `SECTION_BY_ID`),
which groups every section under at most three bold headings sized to fit a
1920x1080 screen without scrolling: **Agent** (general, llms, workspace,
availability, usage), **Workflow & integrations** (automation, railways, apps,
secrets, notifications), and **System** (updates, backup, danger). The dynamic
page (`routes/settings/[section]/+page.svelte`) renders the section matching the
route param, fetching only that section's data, and falls back to "Not found" for
an unknown id. Design decisions folded in: **Automation** and **Railways** moved
off the top nav into settings (`/automation` and `/railways` 308-redirect to their
`/settings/*` homes); **Jira** and **Tailscale** are opt-in integrations under a
single **Apps** page, not native settings; the **Workspace** page groups agent
instructions, the base setup script, the config repo, environment variables,
network access, and container restart/recreate; destructive actions (hard reset)
live in a single **Danger zone**; **Usage & stats** merges the usage-pause
controls with the statistics reset. There is no settings notepad: the global
operator notepad lives on the kanban board.

## The data model (Postgres)

`board_column` (kanban lane: available / todo / in_progress / in_review / done /
**ignored**) and `status` (operational sub-state) are intentionally separate.

- **`settings`** — single row (`id=1`): org profile, `global_instructions`,
  `default_review_policy`, `agent_paused`, `claude_model`, `base_setup_script`
  (= environment setup), `config_repo_url`, `default_branch_template`,
  `current_session_id` (the one shared Claude session), the secret column
  `github_token` (the API only ever exposes `*_token_set` booleans plus a masked
  `*_token_preview`, never the raw values; write via `POST /settings/tokens`).
  The Claude credentials moved off this row into `llm_credentials` (issue #341, see
  below); the usage-pause columns (`usage_limit_pause_enabled`,
  `usage_limit_threshold`, `usage_paused_until`) stay here since they gate the whole
  agent. It also holds the optional **availability schedule**
  (`availability_enabled`, `availability_timezone` (IANA), `availability_windows`
  JSONB, `availability_skip_dates` JSONB). When enabled, the agent only pulls new
  work during the configured weekly windows in the operator's time zone, skipping
  listed dates; empty windows mean "any time of day". The gate is the pure,
  unit-tested `orchestrator::availability::is_available`, checked alongside
  `agent_paused`. It also holds the **notification-sound** prefs
  (`{attention,completion}_sound_enabled` toggles plus the optional uploaded
  `{attention,completion}_sound_audio`/`_mime` clips). Like the tokens, the audio
  bytes never appear in the settings payload (only `*_sound_custom` "is a clip
  set" booleans do); a dedicated `GET/POST/DELETE /settings/sounds/:kind`
  (`kind` = `attention`|`completion`) streams, uploads, or clears them. The UI
  plays the bundled default chime (`frontend/static/sounds/{attention,completion}.wav`,
  regenerable via `frontend/scripts/gen-sounds.py`) when no custom clip is set.
  Attention sounds fire on the `notification`/`heart_attack` SSE events; the
  completion sound fires on a new `task_finished` SSE event emitted from the
  review loop's auto-merge-to-Done path (`ServerEvent::TaskFinished`).
- **`llm_credentials`** (issue #341) — the priority-ordered Claude credentials the
  agent rotates through, managed on the **Settings -> LLMs** subpage. Each row is a
  `kind` (`subscription_oauth` | `setup_token` | `api_key`), a `label`, a fractional
  `position` (lower runs first), `enabled`, the inference `secret`, the refreshing
  OAuth material (subscription OAuth only), `account_email`, an `exhausted_until`
  rotation timer, a `last_error`, and a provider-agnostic `provider` + `base_url`
  (empty = Anthropic direct; a non-Anthropic provider is reached through the LiteLLM
  sidecar's Anthropic endpoint, issue #342). The API never returns raw secrets, only
  a masked `LlmCredentialView` (`GET /credentials`); mutations are
  `POST /credentials/{oauth/start,oauth/finish,token,api-key,reorder}`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /credentials/:id`. The rotation core is `orchestrator::credentials`:
  `active_credential` resolves the highest-priority available credential (enabled,
  has a secret, not exhausted) and refreshes its OAuth token ahead of expiry; a turn
  runs on it (`TurnArgs.credential_kind`/`oauth_token`/`base_url`, exec injects
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, plus `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` when a
  base URL is set). On a `rate_limit_event` the active credential is marked
  `exhausted_until` the reset and `reconcile_pause` either rotates to the next
  credential (clears the global pause) or, when EVERY credential is exhausted, sets
  `settings.usage_paused_until` to the soonest reset. The board header shows the
  active credential's email/label (`board.active_credential`); the usage gauge polls
  the active subscription-OAuth credential when its consent granted `user:profile`.
  `next_actionable_task` stays idle when `has_usable_credential` is false (none
  configured or all exhausted). On first run, migration `0049` moves any existing
  single credential off the `settings` row into this table as entry #1.
- **`environment_variables`** — user-defined `key` / `value` / `is_secret` rows,
  injected into the agent's turn and setup execs at runtime. A secret value is
  scrubbed out of Claude's output before anything is persisted or streamed
  (`secrets::Scrubber`), and the API only ever returns it masked. CRUD via
  `GET`/`PUT /settings/env`.
- **`repositories`** — `full_name`, `clone_url`, `default_branch`,
  `branch_template`, `setup_script` (per-repo setup), `instructions`,
  `review_policy` (NULL = inherit default), `enabled`, `sync_issues` (poll this
  repo for issues), `issue_labels` (label filter), `setup_script_always_run`
  (issue #275: re-run `setup_script` on the persistent clone before every task,
  not just on first clone / full provision; off by default), and `sync_error` /
  `sync_error_at` (issue #213: the last issue-sync failure for the repo, NULL when
  the most recent sync succeeded; set when listing the repo's issues fails, cleared
  on the next clean sync). There is **no** separate issue-source entity; a repo
  with `sync_issues` is its own source. Bulk onboarding is the one-shot **Import
  from org** action (`POST /repos/import-org`). The repositories page also has a
  **multi-select bulk edit** (issue #331), modeled on the board's: a "Bulk edit"
  toggle turns each row into a checkbox target (with a select-all header), and a
  floating action bar bulk-edits fields (`enabled` / `sync_issues`, three-way
  keep/on/off, `POST /repos/bulk/fields`) or deletes the selection
  (`POST /repos/bulk/delete`, with an aggregate blast-radius preview from
  `POST /repos/bulk/deletion-impact`). All three mirror the board's
  `/tasks/bulk/*` handlers and notify the board once per action. **Realtime
  workspace sync (issue #343):** adding/enabling a repo (single add, org import,
  bulk enable, railway reassign) clones it into the workspace **immediately in the
  background** (`orchestrator::repo_sync::sync_repos` -> a spawned task ->
  `provision::clone_repo`), so a fresh repo lands without waiting for the next full
  provision, on a new dir that never disrupts the agent's in-flight turn. Removing
  or disabling one queues its clone dir on `AppState::pending_removals`; the
  railway's agent loop drains it **between tasks** (never mid-turn) and `rm -rf`s
  the dir (`repo_sync::apply_pending_removals`, only into a running container).
  Removal is guarded to a flat `/workspace/{name}` (unsafe names skipped), and the
  config dir `.claude` is never touched.
- **`tasks`** — the cards: `source_kind`, `external_id`, `repo_id`, `title`,
  `board_column`, `position` (fractional rank), `status`, `branch`, `pr_url`,
  `error`, `hold` (agent skips this card), `blocking` (serialize the queue while
  this card is unfinished, see the agent loop), `session_id`.
- **`turns`** / **`events`** — per-task Claude invocations and the append-only
  parsed stream-json (live feed + chat history). Beyond the Claude stream, the
  orchestrator injects synthetic non-Claude events into the same `events` table +
  task SSE stream so they render with no special transport: `ci` step activity
  (issue #185, `orchestrator::ci_watch`) and `lifecycle` PR/issue moments (issue
  #226, `orchestrator::emit_lifecycle_event`). A `lifecycle` payload is
  `{ action: pr_opened | pr_merged | pr_closed | issue_closed, title, url, repo,
  number }`, kept source-agnostic so a future Jira source (transition, comment)
  can reuse it; `repo` is the short repo name, set only when the task spans more
  than one repo so the feed shows a `repo#number` tag exactly when it
  disambiguates. Each fires once per genuine transition (PR detection, our
  squash-merge, an external merge/close found by the review refresh, a per-task
  reset close, and the issue-close-on-Done path). Both flow through the
  synthetic CI turn (`get_or_create_ci_turn`).
- **`environment_suggestions`** — recommendations the agent makes about a task
  (`title`, `detail`, `acknowledged`, `kind`), of two kinds sharing one pipeline:
  `environment` setup tips (the `seraphim-suggest` helper) and, at the end of a
  task, `follow_up` work it noticed but kept out of scope (dead/duplicate code,
  tech debt, an inefficient process, a missing security layer, a now-unused system
  to deprecate; the `seraphim-followup` helper, issue #272). Both post to
  `POST /agent/suggestions` (`kind` defaults to `environment`); both show loudly on
  the board (one badge, count is kind-agnostic) and as checkboxes on the task,
  split by kind ("Environment recommendations" / "Follow-up work"), until
  acknowledged. A split "Create issue" button (`POST /suggestions/:id/create` with
  `target` internal/github/jira) turns one into a tracked issue (internal task, a
  GitHub issue in the task's repo via octocrab, or a Jira ticket) and marks it done.
  Follow-ups get a light de-dup: a normalized-title check (`suggestions::already_queued`,
  unit-tested) drops any whose title matches a task still on the board, so the agent
  never re-recommends queued work. Both standing instructions live in the shared
  prompt header (`ENVIRONMENT_SUGGESTIONS`, `FOLLOW_UP_SUGGESTIONS`). Beyond the
  per-task checkboxes, a top-nav **Suggestions** tab (`/suggestions`, issue #324)
  aggregates every recommendation across all tasks for bulk triage:
  `GET /suggestions` (`queries::list_all_suggestions`) returns each suggestion plus
  its task's title/source/repo-link and its repo `full_name` + issue ref/url
  (`AggregatedSuggestion`). The page (reworked in issue #364) groups the list by
  **repo, then by originating task** (`lib/suggestions.ts`, pure + unit-tested), each
  task headed by a clickable issue badge (`#123`) and its full name. Each suggestion
  is a `SuggestionCard`: title-first, a three-line clamped description that expands on
  click, small kind badge, and the `SuggestionCreateButton` split dropdown, which now
  also carries the mark-complete / reopen action (the old left toggle is gone). Rows
  multi-select with shift-click range like the board, and a `SuggestionBulkBar` marks
  a batch complete or reopens it. Open items on top, acknowledged ones greyed below.
- **`setup_script_changes`** (issue #340) — setup-script edits the agent made to
  **itself** through the **Seraphim MCP** (`workspace/seraphim-mcp`), so it can
  apply an environment optimization it spots (e.g. "add `cd frontend && yarn
  install` so UI tasks build immediately") instead of only recommending it via
  `seraphim-suggest`. The MCP is a hand-rolled zero-dep stdio server (like the
  `seraphim-*` helpers), registered at user scope by the entrypoint alongside the
  Playwright MCP, and exposes `list_setup_scripts`, `update_repo_setup_script`, and
  `update_base_setup_script`, backed by `GET /agent/setup-scripts` and
  `POST /agent/setup-scripts/{repo,base}` (`http/setup_scripts.rs`). Every edit
  replaces a repo's `setup_script` or the global `base_setup_script` and records a
  row here with the before/after, `target` (`repo`|`base`), `summary` (the agent's
  one-line why), and the `task_id` it was working. `update_repo_setup_script` can
  also toggle the repo's `setup_script_always_run` flag (issue #348): its
  `setup_script` is optional and an `always_run` bool sets the flag, so the agent
  can make its own setup edit re-run before every task on the existing clone, not
  just on first clone. A flag toggle is recorded on the same row (`always_run`:
  `NULL` when untouched, else the value set) so the audit and banner stay honest.
  The change is **never silent**:
  the board shows the unacknowledged ones in a banner (via the board payload) and a
  one-time toast + native notification fires (`ServerEvent::SetupScriptChanged`),
  cleared by `POST /setup-changes/:id/ack`. No-op edits are rejected so the audit
  holds only real changes; a base change takes effect on the next provision/recreate.
  A standing prompt instruction (`prompt::SETUP_SCRIPT_AUTONOMY`) tells the agent it
  can apply the change itself, with accountability.
- **`questions`** — decisions the agent escalated to the user, stored on the task
  (`prompt`, up to three suggested `options`, `status`, the chosen `answer`).
  Posted by the agent's `seraphim-ask` helper, answered in the task view, and
  surfaced as toasts + native notifications + a sidebar. A task stays
  `waiting_for_input` until **every** question on it is answered, so a junk
  question would block it forever; `POST /agent/questions` therefore rejects a
  blank (empty or whitespace-only) `prompt` with a 400 rather than persisting it
  (issue #368), and `seraphim-ask` handles `--help` and refuses a shell-mangled
  JSON payload so a slip never posts one.
- **`task_screenshots`** (issue #248) — screenshots the agent captured during a
  task (via the Playwright MCP, issue #243), so the operator sees what the agent
  saw. The agent's `seraphim-screenshot <file>` helper POSTs the raw image bytes to
  `POST /agent/screenshots` (Content-Type = MIME, metadata as query params:
  `task_id`, `caption`, `route`, `width`/`height`); the capture is best-effort
  associated with the task's latest turn (`turn_id`). The bytes live as `bytea`
  following the notification-sound precedent and are NEVER returned in task/board
  JSON: a dedicated `GET /screenshots/:id` streams them (immutable cache), and
  `TaskDetail.screenshots` carries metadata only. The task view renders them as a
  lazy-loaded gallery (newest first, caption / route / dimensions; click opens the
  full image). On capture, the upload handler also emits a `screenshot` **activity
  event** (issue #249) onto the task's current turn (`append_event` + `notify_task`,
  mirroring `ci_watch`), carrying the id + metadata, never the bytes. That surfaces
  the screenshot as a lazy-loaded inline **thumbnail** in the live activity feed
  (watch page) and the task's saved history; clicking any thumbnail (feed, history,
  or gallery) opens the shared `ScreenshotLightbox` (fullscreen, Escape to close,
  arrow-key paging through that task's screenshots, click to zoom). Privacy:
  dev/test-data screenshots only, since the bytes persist in Postgres (respect
  at-rest disk encryption as with the other blobs/secrets). The optional
  GitHub-issue/PR attachment toggle is not built yet (left to a follow-up).
- **`task_attachments`** (issue #291) — files attached to a ticket so the agent
  actually sees them: operator uploads on an internal ticket, plus source-ticket
  attachments (Jira) pulled into ticket data on sync/work. One shared table keyed
  by `task_id`, carrying a `source` (`operator` | `jira` | `github`) and, for
  pulled ones, the source tracker's `external_id` (deduped via a partial unique
  index so a re-pull never duplicates). The bytes live as `bytea` and are NEVER
  returned in task/board JSON, mirroring `task_screenshots`: an operator uploads
  one file per request to `POST /tasks/:id/attachments` (raw body = bytes,
  Content-Type = MIME, `?filename=`; no multipart dep, like screenshots),
  `GET /attachments/:id` streams them (immutable cache, `Content-Disposition`
  carries the file name), and `TaskDetail.attachments` carries metadata only. The
  task view shows images as thumbnails and other files as download links, with an
  "Add files" control on internal tickets; the create-issue form uploads selected
  files right after the ticket exists. **Jira capture:** on a Jira ticket's first
  sync, and again when the agent works it, `orchestrator::capture_jira_attachments`
  lists the issue's attachments (`JiraClient::list_attachments`) and downloads +
  stores each not-already-stored one (`download_attachment`, deduped on the Jira
  attachment id), so its screenshots/logs are captured with no manual Jira CLI
  fetch (best-effort; oversized files past `MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` are skipped).
  **Prompt:** `prompt::build` renders an `# Attachments` section
  (`render_attachments`): small text/log files are inlined head/tail-capped
  (`ATTACHMENT_INLINE_TEXT_CAP`), images/binaries are listed as openable refs the
  agent fetches with `curl "$SERAPHIM_API_URL/api/v1/attachments/<id>"`. Same
  at-rest-encryption caveat as the other blobs.
- **`heart_attacks`** — recorded "heart attacks" (turns that died mid-flight),
  written by the defibrillator loop (see above), never by a request. Each holds a
  task snapshot, the status at death, the diagnostic `detail` (error logs kept for
  later patching), what the defibrillator did (`recovery`), and `acknowledged`.
  The board reads the unacknowledged ones into its payload and shows a dismissible
  red banner; `POST /heart-attacks/:id/ack` clears one.
- **`automation_rules`** — user-defined rules (Automation page). When a GitHub
  webhook delivers an issue `created`/`updated`/`comment` event, each enabled
  rule whose source + trigger match is checked against the event; if its
  condition group (AND/OR of `{field, operator, values}`, operators
  exactly (case-insensitive)/exactly_case_sensitive/contains/has_one_of/is_empty/
  is_not_empty over labels/author/repo/
  title/body/comment/state) matches, its action runs (move the card to top/bottom
  of To Do). The rule shape + the pure matcher live in `src/automation/`
  (unit-tested, I/O-free); firing lives in `orchestrator::run_github_automation`
  (called from `http/webhooks.rs` and the poll sync). Source-agnostic (rules can
  target `any`), but only GitHub events are wired so far. The webhook is the
  realtime path for all triggers; the poll sync is the reliable fallback for
  `Created` rules (issue #229): when `upsert_github_issue` first inserts an issue
  (it returns whether the issue was brand-new), `sync_repo_issues` fires `Created`
  automation for it, exactly once on that first-insert transition, never re-firing
  as the same issue is re-listed each poll. So `Created` rules work without any
  webhook; `Updated` / `Comment` triggers remain webhook-only (poll-firing those
  needs change detection). When an enabled rule exists but no GitHub webhook secret
  is set, the Automation page shows a dismissible notice so a rule never sits
  silently inert.

## How the agent runtime works (the workspace)

- Claude is **always spawned at `/workspace`** as the non-root `codespace` user (the universal devcontainer image's user).
- **Every enabled repo** is cloned flat at `/workspace/{repo-name}` (name = part
  after `/`), so cross-repo work is natural. The task names a focus repo + branch.
- **Instructions become files:** global → `/workspace/AGENTS.md`; per-repo →
  `/workspace/{repo}/CLAUDE.md` (Claude auto-loads them).
- **Visual self-review (issues #244, #245):** every task prompt carries a standing
  instruction (`prompt::VISUAL_SELF_REVIEW`, in the shared header so it applies on
  fresh work and fix/revisit turns alike) to look at any UI change in a real
  browser before declaring it done, via the Playwright MCP baked into the workspace
  (issue #243): start the dev server (test data only), open the affected route(s),
  and check layout with computed styles (cheaper and less ambiguous than
  screenshots; screenshot only to confirm), at mobile (375px) and desktop (1280px).
  Computed-style checks are the workhorse: a documented, reusable check library
  (`workspace/visual-checks.md`, baked into the image at
  `/usr/local/share/seraphim/visual-checks.md`, issue #245) provides deterministic
  centering / spacing / overflow / stacking pass-fail assertions the agent runs
  through the Playwright MCP `browser_evaluate`. The per-repo dev-server facts live
  in that repo's `CLAUDE.md` (i.e. `repositories.instructions`): record the dev
  command, base URL/port, and key routes there, e.g. "dev server: `npm run dev` on
  :5173; check /, /login, /dashboard". The loop degrades gracefully: a repo with no
  runnable UI is skipped with a noted reason, never failed.
  - **Visual regression baselines (issue #246):** the long-game complement, for
    locking a confirmed-good screen against future regressions. An **opt-in,
    per-repo** recipe (`workspace/visual-regression.md`, baked at
    `/usr/local/share/seraphim/visual-regression.md`) documents committed Playwright
    `toHaveScreenshot()` baselines plus anti-flake guidance (fixed viewport,
    disabled animations, masked dynamic regions, deterministic data, same
    environment to generate and diff). It runs in the repo's own test suite via the
    standalone `@playwright/test` runner, NOT the MCP (the MCP has no pixel
    comparison). Baselines are committed in the repo under test, never in Seraphim;
    `VISUAL_SELF_REVIEW` points at the recipe but the agent only uses it where a
    repo's `CLAUDE.md` opts in. An unexpected diff is a regression to investigate,
    not a baseline to bump.
  - **Constrain the design space (issue #247):** a sibling build-time standing
    instruction (`prompt::DESIGN_PRIMITIVES`, also in the shared header) steers UI
    work to compose from the repo's existing layout primitives (`<Stack gap="md">`
    and friends) and spacing-scale tokens, and to match neighboring components,
    instead of hand-rolled `margin`/`padding` (fewer degrees of freedom, fewer ways
    to be wrong). The fuller guidance plus the optional Figma-spec path (use the
    Figma MCP to implement against real numbers, then validate with the
    computed-style checks; opt-in, no Figma MCP is wired by default) lives in
    `workspace/design-system.md`, baked at
    `/usr/local/share/seraphim/design-system.md`. The concrete tokens and primitives
    live in each repo under test, not here.
- **Two-tier setup:** environment setup (`settings.base_setup_script`) runs once
  per provision/recreate (install CLIs/toolchains); per-repo setup
  (`repositories.setup_script`) runs after each clone (e.g. `yarn install`). A
  repo can opt into `setup_script_always_run` (issue #275) to re-run its setup
  script before *every* task on the persistent clone, not just on first clone,
  so a stacked-dependency merge that adds new deps gets them reinstalled before
  the task's build/test. The toggle flows through `provision::prepare_branch` /
  `prepare_existing_branch` into `repo_block`'s `always_setup` (which already
  governed the full-provision re-run); no "did the lockfile change" guard.
- **Submodules (issue #251):** a cloned repo's git submodules are initialized
  automatically (`provision::submodule_update_snippet`, generic to any repo with a
  `.gitmodules`), before its setup script, on clone and after a branch checkout.
  It does NOT fail silently: a denied/missing private submodule (the common cause:
  the mounted host SSH/deploy key lacks read access, e.g. Plunder's private `brand`
  submodule) aborts prep with a message naming the offending submodule URL(s) and
  the fix (grant the key read access; for `brand` that is the `BRAND_DEPLOY_KEY`
  deploy key), instead of a generic build failure mid-task. Relies on the mounted
  host key only; no private key material is baked into the image.
- **`~/.claude`** comes from cloning `settings.config_repo_url` into
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/workspace/.claude` (git init+fetch+checkout so untracked
  `projects/` — the persisted session — survives). No host mount. This is a
  **dedicated, hard-failing step** (`provision::provision_config_repo`): on
  failure it records `settings.config_repo_error`, the board shows a red banner,
  and `next_actionable_task` **halts the agent** (refuses to pull work) until it
  succeeds. A blank `config_repo_url` bypasses the halt (agent runs unconfigured).
  The workspace entrypoint also symlinks the agent's `~/.claude`
  (`/home/codespace/.claude`) at `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so the global instructions'
  documented home-dir paths (`~/.claude/orgs/*.md`, `~/.claude/docs/*.md`)
  resolve, since the agent's `$HOME` is `/home/codespace`, not `/workspace`
  (issue #259). `$HOME` is deliberately **not** moved to `/workspace`: SSH keys
  (`~/.ssh`) and `gh auth setup-git` credentials live under `/home/codespace`, so
  relocating `$HOME` would break SSH cloning and git/gh auth; the symlink fixes
  the path resolution with no such side effects.
- **Claude invocation** (`api/src/claude/exec.rs`):
  `claude -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode bypassPermissions --model <model> [--resume <session>]`,
  exec'd as user `codespace`, cwd `/workspace`. All tasks resume the one shared
  `current_session_id`; Claude auto-compacts.
- **Auth:** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription) for Claude; mounted host
  `~/.ssh` for `git@` clones; `GH_TOKEN` for HTTPS + octocrab.
- **Git identity (issue #214):** the entrypoint writes a SYSTEM-wide
  `git config --system user.name/email` from `GIT_USER_NAME` / `GIT_USER_EMAIL`
  (`.env`, with a safe `Seraphim` fallback), so the agent can commit in every flat
  clone under `/workspace` without per-repo setup. A repo-local `user.*` still
  overrides it.
- **Rust toolchains baked (issue #370):** the workspace image preinstalls rustup +
  stable, the pinned `1.88` build toolchain (with `rustfmt` + `clippy`), and the
  date-pinned nightly (with `rustfmt`) that a repo's nightly-only fmt gate uses
  (crew's `Format (nightly)`, `cargo +$NIGHTLY fmt`), so both `cargo +1.88 fmt` and
  `cargo +<nightly> fmt` run on a fresh workspace with no first-run "component not
  installed" stall. The nightly is the `RUST_NIGHTLY` Dockerfile build arg; keep it
  in sync with that repo's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `NIGHTLY`.
- **Local DB validation:** PostgreSQL 17 (client + server) is baked into the
  workspace image, and `pg-ephemeral` boots a throwaway PG17 on `127.0.0.1` and
  prints a `DATABASE_URL` (`export DATABASE_URL="$(pg-ephemeral)"`), so the agent
  can verify migrations / integration tests against the same major as CI and
  prod without a daemon. The entrypoint also aligns the agent to the mounted host
  Docker socket's group, so `docker` / `earthly` work without `sudo` too.
- **Browser e2e (issue #215):** Playwright's Chromium plus its OS libraries are
  baked into the workspace image, into a shared world-readable
  `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright` (the official Playwright-in-Docker
  convention) so any user finds it, so the agent can run Plunder's `yarn test:e2e`
  immediately with no per-run `playwright install --with-deps`. The browser is
  pinned to the Playwright version Plunder uses (`PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION` build arg);
  if that drifts, only the browser re-downloads on first run, never the slow apt
  dependency step.
- **Playwright MCP, the agent's eyes (issue #243):** the headless browser the
  visual self-review (issues #244-247) drives. `@playwright/mcp` (`PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VERSION`
  build arg, pinned `0.0.76`) is installed globally and its `playwright-mcp` bin
  symlinked onto `/usr/local/bin`. The MCP bundles its OWN Playwright, pinned to a
  DIFFERENT Chromium than the #215 stable build (alpha -> revision 1226, vs 1228), so
  the Dockerfile bakes that exact build (currently rev 1226) with the MCP's own Playwright into
  `/ms-playwright`; a turn never downloads a browser at runtime. It must be the FULL
  Chromium build, not the headless shell (issue #299): in this MCP/Playwright version
  `--browser chromium` resolves to the `chrome-for-testing` channel, which launches
  the full Chrome-for-Testing build (dir `chromium-<rev>`) even under `--headless`,
  so a shell-only bake left it failing at runtime with `Browser "chrome-for-testing" is
  not installed` and visual self-review was skipped. It is installed via the MCP's
  own `playwright-mcp install-browser chrome-for-testing` (the command its own error
  prescribes), and only that browser dir is chmod-ed (a recursive chmod over
  `/ms-playwright` would copy #215's browsers up into the layer and add ~650MB). The
  entrypoint registers the server at **user scope** in `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`
  (`claude mcp add -s user playwright -- playwright-mcp --headless --browser chromium
  --no-sandbox --isolated`), idempotently (remove-then-add), so `claude -p
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions` loads it with NO per-task approval gate (a
  project `.mcp.json` would sit unapproved). The Chromium revision is NOT hardcoded
  (issue #307): the Dockerfile derives it at build time from the MCP's bundled
  `playwright-core/browsers.json` (the `chromium` entry's `revision`, currently
  `1226`), so a `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VERSION` bump needs no manual revision edits. That one
  resolved value drives both the chmod and a build-time gate that fails the image (and
  prints the expected revision plus the dirs present under `/ms-playwright`) if the MCP
  bin or the resolved `chromium-<rev>` chrome executable is missing; both the MCP and
  bundled playwright-core versions are logged for attributability. `docker compose build workspace` needs a
  populated `.env` (the compose volume interpolation), so a bare checkout builds the
  image directly with `docker build ./workspace`.
### The orchestrator loops (`api/src/orchestrator/mod.rs`)
1. **sync** — polls every repo with `sync_issues` for open issues and upserts
   them into the **top** of **Available** (never clobbers human-set
   column/position). Tasks are unique per `(repo_id, source_kind, external_id)`.
   Callable via `POST /sync`. Realtime alternative: inbound webhooks
   (`POST /api/v1/webhooks/{github,jira}`, in `http/webhooks.rs`) apply the same
   upsert the instant an issue changes, authenticated by a per-provider shared
   secret on the settings row (GitHub HMAC-signs the body; Jira signs or carries
   `?secret=`). Both poll and webhook share `orchestrator::upsert_{github,jira}_issue`.
   Sync also **reflects external state changes** onto the board: a GitHub issue
   closed outside Seraphim moves its card to **Done**, a reopened one back to
   **Available**, and a Jira status change moves the card to its newly mapped
   column. This fires only on a genuine transition (via `queries::apply_external_
   state`, guarded by `external_state IS DISTINCT FROM`), so steady-state syncs
   never clobber human curation, and a card the agent is mid-work on
   (`in_progress`) is left alone. The poll also pulls recently-closed issues
   (`git::list_recently_closed_issues`) since the open list can't reveal a closure.
   A repo whose issue list fails no longer fails silently (issue #213): each repo
   syncs as its own fallible unit (`sync_repo_issues`), and a failure records a
   per-repo `sync_error` (with the HTTP status and, for 403/404, a "grant the token
   access" hint), shows a persistent dismissible board banner + the error on the
   repos page, and emits a one-time notification on the success->error transition
   (`ServerEvent::RepoSyncError`). The next clean sync clears it; one repo's failure
   never stops the others. (The webhook path delivers a single pre-fetched issue, so
   it has no per-repo listing step to fail.)
2. **agent** — single-threaded: when not paused, the config repo is healthy, and
   inside the availability schedule, it picks work by priority — (a) **resume** a
   task whose question the user just answered (`waiting_for_input` → deliver the
   answers via `prompt::build_resume`), (b) a PR with failing CI to fix
   (`ci_failing`), (c) a PR whose auto-merge failed on a conflict to resolve
   (`merge_conflict` → `prompt::build_merge_conflict`: merge the base in, resolve,
   keep migrations linear), (d) a green PR with unresolved review comments to
   address (`addressing_review` → `prompt::build_address_review`: apply/decline
   each comment, reply, resolve the threads, push), (e) top of **To Do** (fresh
   issue → branch → Claude turn → detect PR → **In Review**, or **park** as
   `waiting_for_input` if the agent asked a question), then (f) when nothing else is
   queued, *revisit* a PR it gave up on (`ci_blocked`), cooldown-gated
   (`REVISIT_COOLDOWN`, 15 min). The agent
   asks via the `seraphim-ask` CLI, records environment recommendations via
   `seraphim-suggest`, bubbles up follow-up work via `seraphim-followup` (issue
   #272), and uploads screenshots via `seraphim-screenshot` (all baked into the
   workspace image), posting to `POST /agent/questions`, `POST /agent/suggestions`,
   and `POST /agent/screenshots`; the exec injects `SERAPHIM_TASK_ID` +
   `SERAPHIM_API_URL`. One task awaited to completion before the next (no overlap).
   - **Blocking tasks (queue serialization, issue #302):** a task flagged
     `blocking` holds back step (e), pulling fresh **To Do** work, for as long as it
     is unfinished, where "unfinished" spans `in_progress` AND `in_review` until its
     PR squash-merges to **Done** (`queries::has_active_blocking_task`, scoped per
     railway). The gate deliberately does NOT drop the instant the PR opens and the
     card moves to In Review: the agent must not race ahead to the next issue while
     the blocking PR is still running CI / awaiting merge. Steps (a)-(d) (resume, CI
     fix, conflict resolve, review address) are NOT gated, so the blocking task's own
     PR keeps advancing to a merge; only new work waits. A blocking task in
     `available`/`todo` (not started), `done` (merged), or `ignored` does not gate.
   - **Stacked dependencies (issue #256):** a fresh ticket that depends on another
     ticket whose PR is still open builds on a default branch that lacks that work.
     A `Depends on:` marker in the ticket body (e.g. `Depends on: A1 (package
     scaffold), #5`) is parsed (pure, unit-tested `orchestrator::dependencies`) and
     each reference matched, by GitHub issue number or a title word-set match,
     against the railway's in-flight tasks that have an open PR
     (`queries::list_open_dependency_candidates`). Each matched dependency's PR
     branch and its repos are surfaced in the fresh-work prompt
     (`prompt::build` → "Stacked on unmerged dependencies"), which tells the agent
     to `git merge origin/<dep-branch>` first and NOT re-implement that work. The
     branch is still cut from the default branch (issue #256 option 2); merging the
     dependency in is robust across a chain (A3 → A2 → A1, since A2's branch already
     carries A1). When the dependency has merged it is no longer an open-PR
     candidate, so the ticket builds from the default branch as before.
3. **review** — gates each task on **all** of its pull requests. A task can span
   several repos (the agent opens a same-named branch + PR in each); every PR is
   tracked in `task_pull_requests` and the task only reaches **Done** once they
   have all merged. The pure, unit-tested `orchestrator::review::decide` takes the
   tick's action from the set of PRs (`refresh_task_prs` updates each PR's CI +
   lifecycle first): any open PR failing → hand back to the agent; any pending →
   wait; once every open PR is green, it must clear the review gate before merging
   or holding (zero unresolved threads and no "changes requested" review, see
   below); then merge the green `auto_squash_merge`
   PRs now; once all are settled and at
   least one merged → **Done** (and, for a GitHub-sourced task, close the linked
   issue with `state_reason: "completed"` when `close_issue_on_done` is set, the
   default; best-effort); open passing human-review PRs → hold. A red PR is bounded
   by `MAX_CI_FIX_ATTEMPTS` (3) before parking `ci_blocked`; the CI-fix turn checks
   out the branch in every repo with a PR and tags each failing check with its
   `repo#pr`. A failed auto-merge (almost always a base conflict because another PR
   landed first) flags the task `merge_conflict` so the agent resolves it on its
   branch instead of giving up, bounded by the same attempt budget; if the agent
   pushes nothing (genuinely unresolvable) or the budget is exhausted, it falls
   back to `ci_blocked` for a human. The single-PR case is just a one-row set, so
   its behavior is unchanged.
   - **Parked unmergeable PRs (issues #304, #314, #315):** an open PR GitHub cannot
     squash-merge is **held in review**, never merge-attempted or re-dispatched, so
     the merge-fails-then-flagged-a-conflict loop can't happen. Two cases qualify: an
     **empty net diff** (e.g. the agent parks a cross-repo blocker by opening a draft
     PR with a single empty commit documenting it, issue #304) and a **draft of any
     size** (GitHub refuses to merge a draft until it is marked ready, issue #315).
     The refresh records each PR's `is_draft` / `is_empty` shape (`git::pr_status`
     reads `draft` + `changed_files`), and `pr_review_of` maps either to
     `review::PrReview::Parked` ahead of the CI/review checks: it is never
     merge-attempted, CI-fixed, addressed, or re-dispatched, just held until a human
     or unblock event (a non-empty diff, a "ready for review") acts on it
     (`review::decide` keeps the task out of Done while a parked PR remains).
     `merge_task_prs` also treats a `failed to squash-merge` on a now-empty-or-draft
     PR as benign ("not mergeable yet", leave parked), not a conflict. An empty PR
     that is NOT a draft is unexpected, so it is also **surfaced on the board**
     (issue #314), not just held: `refresh_task_prs` fires a one-time
     `ServerEvent::AnomalousEmptyPr` (toast + native notification) on the transition
     into the anomaly, and the board payload carries a derived, self-clearing
     `anomalous_empty_prs` list (`queries::list_anomalous_empty_prs`, open +
     `is_empty` + not `is_draft`, and only for tasks still in an active column) that
     drives a self-clearing banner, mirroring the repo-sync-error banner; it drops off
     once the PR gains changes, closes, is marked draft, or its task settles. Tasks in
     a terminal column (`done`, `ignored`) never raise the banner (issue #369): the
     review loop only refreshes `pr_state` while it still gates a task, so a settled
     task's PR could otherwise leave `pr_state` stuck at `'open'` and the banner
     permanently raised; a settled task's PR is not an anomaly. Non-empty, non-draft
     (ready) PRs follow the normal review-gate + auto-merge flow.
   - **Review-comment gate (issues #255, #270):** a green PR is NEVER squash-merged
     while it carries review work, no matter its approval state. The merge gate is
     exactly **CI green AND zero unresolved review threads AND no outstanding
     "changes requested" review** (approval alone never merges). For each green open
     PR, `git::pr_review_status` reads both signals in one GraphQL round trip
     (`reviewThreads { isResolved }` for unresolved threads from the org CI reviewer
     bots `mooreslabai-claude` / `mooreslabai-codex` or humans, plus `reviewDecision`
     for a standing `CHANGES_REQUESTED`). It **fails closed** (`pr_review_status` ->
     `Err` -> `Unknown`): GraphQL returns HTTP 200 even on field errors, so a body
     carrying `errors` or a null `pullRequest` is treated as "could not read" and is
     never read as "zero threads" (the hole that let an APPROVED PR with open threads
     merge, issue #270, locked by unit tests on `review_status_from_response`). That
     collapses to a per-PR `ReviewState` (`Clean` / `Outstanding` / `Unknown`) which
     `review::decide` gates on before any merge or hold:
     - **Outstanding** (threads and/or changes-requested) with attempts left → flag
       `addressing_review` (`queries::flag_review_addressing`), emit a `ci`-style
       feed note; the agent loop picks it up (`pick_next_review_address`) and runs an
       addressing turn (`build_address_review`) listing each comment tagged with
       `repo#pr` + `file:line` + author + body, plus the handles to reply and
       resolve. The agent implements what it agrees with and, for every thread
       (including ones it declines, with a brief reason), replies and resolves it via
       the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation. The turn is best-effort and never
       blocks on "nothing pushed": it returns to review, where the loop waits for CI
       to re-run and re-checks the threads, repeating until clean.
     - **Outstanding with the budget spent** (`MAX_REVIEW_FIX_ATTEMPTS`, 3, on the
       dedicated `review_fix_attempts` counter) → **park for a human** (`ReviewDecision::Block`
       → `handle_review_blocked`, which reuses the `ci_blocked` park with a
       review-specific note). It is **never merged over** open comments; an idle
       revisit later resets `review_fix_attempts` and tries again.
     - **Unknown** (the review lookup failed: a transport error, GraphQL `errors`, or
       a missing `pullRequest`) → wait and re-check next tick, never merge on a guess.
       A persistent `Unknown` means the PR sits in review without merging (safe) and
       the cause is logged (`could not read review status`), so a token/permission
       gap on the GraphQL `reviewThreads` query surfaces as "stops merging" rather
       than "merges unreviewed".
4. **defibrillator** (dead-agent management) — recovers turns that die mid-flight,
   which we call a **"heart attack"**: the agent hangs with no output, its stream
   breaks, or the turn aborts internally, leaving the card stranded `in_progress`
   and the `claude -p` child possibly leaked. Detection is layered: an **in-turn
   heartbeat** in `stream_turn` (each wait for the next event is bounded by
   `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`, 20 min; a longer silence ends the turn as a heart attack),
   the `agent_loop` catching a turn that aborted with an error, and a background
   **watchdog** (`defibrillator_loop`) that reaps any task left `working` with no
   activity past `WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` (25 min, strictly above the heartbeat so it
   never races a live turn). All three funnel into `defibrillate`, which kills the
   orphaned process (`kill_agent_process`), records a `heart_attacks` incident with
   the diagnostic detail, and revives the task — requeue to **To Do** if it had no
   PR, else back to **In Review** — bounded by `MAX_DEFIBRILLATIONS` (3) before it
   leaves the task failed for a human. Each incident alerts the operator: a
   persistent, dismissible red banner on the board (carrying the error logs) plus a
   toast and native notification. The revive-vs-give-up choice is the pure,
   unit-tested `decide_recovery`.

- UI: `http://localhost:31415` (your bookmark).
- Chosen non-standard and below the Linux ephemeral range. There should be **no**
  `8080`/`3000` anywhere; grep before reintroducing them.

```

`.env` (gitignored) holds the Postgres creds (bootstrap), ports, `SSH_HOME`,
`TS_AUTHKEY`, and the agent's git identity (`GIT_USER_NAME` / `GIT_USER_EMAIL`).
The **Claude OAuth + GitHub tokens are NOT in `.env`** — set them in
the Settings UI (stored in the DB; a worm scanning `.env` files can't harvest
them). The Postgres password stays in `.env` because the API needs it to connect
before it can read anything; for at-rest protection use host disk encryption
(BitLocker / LUKS), which Postgres does not do itself. The `octocrab` client is
built on demand from the DB token, and the agent's `claude`/`git` execs get the
tokens injected as env at call time. Migrations are embedded at compile time
(`sqlx::migrate!`) and run on API boot.

**Self-update** (Settings -> Updates, `src/update/`): the running image is stamped
with `GIT_SHA`/`GIT_BRANCH` (compose build args set by `scripts/start.sh` from
host git, baked in `api/Dockerfile`). The hourly check compares that to the
branch's latest commit via the GitHub API. The "Update" button refuses while a
turn is in progress, pauses the agent, then launches a detached `docker:cli`
**updater container** (via the Docker socket) that bind-mounts the host repo
(`HOST_REPO_DIR`) + socket + `SSH_HOME` and runs `git pull` + `docker compose up
-d --build`; being outside the compose project, it survives the API being rebuilt.
The UI then polls `/version` and reloads when the commit changes. `HOST_REPO_DIR`
is the only new required env for the in-app update (the check works without it).

**Host self-updater (issue #346, `scripts/update.*` + `scripts/install.*`):** a
host-side alternative to the in-app button, for keeping a deployment current with
no clicks. `scripts/update.sh` (Linux/macOS/Git Bash) and `scripts/update.ps1`
(Windows PowerShell 5.1+) run one pass: only on `main`/`develop`, only when the
tree is clean and behind its upstream, they wait for the agent to catch up (the
`agent_caught_up` flag on `GET /update/status`, true when To Do / In Progress /
In Review hold no agent action items), pause it (`POST /settings/pause`, which the
board reflects), drain the in-flight turn (`agent_working`), `git pull --ff-only`,
relaunch via `scripts/start.sh` (or `docker compose up -d --build` on Windows),
then resume unless the operator had it paused. The update proceeds even if the API
is unreachable (no graceful pause then). `scripts/install.sh` installs a systemd
timer (`seraphim-update.{service,timer}`, default 15 min; prints cron instructions
when `systemctl` is absent); `scripts/install.ps1` registers the `SeraphimSelfUpdater`
Scheduled Task. `uninstall.*` remove them. All knobs are `SERAPHIM_*` env vars
(see `scripts/README.md`). This path does its own `git pull` + compose on the host,
so it needs no `HOST_REPO_DIR` and no updater container.

## LiteLLM proxy sidecar (issue #342)

Groundwork toward running the agent on any LiteLLM-supported LLM (OpenAI, xAI
Grok, Moonshot Kimi, ...). The `litellm` compose service is a **lightweight**
LiteLLM proxy: it translates other providers' message shapes to and from the
Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`) that the Claude Code CLI speaks. Lives in
`litellm/` (`config.yaml` = the model routes, `README.md` = the how-to).

- **Lightweight** = proxy only, no database (no `DATABASE_URL` / `STORE_MODEL_IN_DB`,
  so it skips Prisma and boots from `config.yaml`), no admin UI (`DISABLE_ADMIN_UI`),
  no telemetry. The `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm` image (pinned) is the DB-free proxy;
  the `litellm-database` variant is the heavier one, deliberately not used.
- **Opt-in.** It only starts under the `llm` profile
  (`docker compose --profile llm up -d litellm`), so a default deployment carries
  no extra container. Internal-only, reachable at `http://litellm:4000`; not exposed
  on a host port.
- **Config.** Routes in `litellm/config.yaml` map a requested `model_name` to a
  `<provider>/<model>`. Keys come from `.env` (`LITELLM_MASTER_KEY` for client auth;
  `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` / `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` for the routes); an unset
  provider key just fails that route at call time, so the proxy still starts.
- **Not wired in yet.** Selecting a model per credential and pointing the agent's
  `claude` exec at the proxy (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://litellm:4000`) is future
  work (issue #341). This sidecar is the translation layer that will build on.

## Local dev / checks (must pass before committing)

```bash
cd api      && cargo +1.88 fmt && cargo +1.88 clippy --all-targets && cargo +1.88 test
cd frontend && npm run check && npm run build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs these three jobs independently (no
fail-fast) on every PR and on `main`/`develop`.

**Frontend dev server (for the agent's visual self-review, issue #244):**
`cd frontend && npm run dev` serves the UI on `:5173` (`vite dev`, which proxies
`/api` to the backend). Key routes to eyeball after a UI change: `/` (the kanban
board), `/settings` (the grid) plus its subpages (e.g. `/settings/workspace`,
`/settings/railways`), and `/task/<id>`. After any change to this
frontend, follow the visual self-review loop (open the affected route(s) with the
Playwright MCP, check layout via computed styles at 375px and 1280px).

For a **data-backed** page (repositories, board, task views), boot a throwaway
backend with `scripts/dev-api.sh up` (issue #351): it starts an ephemeral
Postgres, runs the API on `:27182`, and seeds a few dev repositories, so the page
has live data to review. Then `cd frontend && yarn dev` and open the route;
`scripts/dev-api.sh down` (or `stop`/`reset`) tears it down. See `scripts/README.md`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Search with `rg`, not `grep` (issue #295).** The agent shell's `grep` is a
  Claude Code wrapper backed by ripgrep with `-I` (skip files it deems binary) and
  `--ignore-files` (respect `.gitignore`). So `grep` silently returns no matches
  for a file with a stray NUL byte (it looks binary) or any ignored file, which
  reads as "empty" when it is not. Prefer `rg` for code search; if a file ever
  looks un-searchable, check it for NUL bytes
  (`python3 -c "print(open(p,'rb').read().count(0))"`) rather than trusting an
  empty `grep`. A literal NUL in a `.rs`/`.ts` source is a defect (usually a paste
  artifact in a comment or string) and should be removed, not worked around. CI now
  guards against this regressing (issue #305): the **Source hygiene** job runs
  `scripts/check-control-chars.py`, which fails the PR if any tracked text file
  (binary assets and the vendored `.yarn/` bundle excluded) contains a NUL byte or
  other control character besides tab / newline / carriage return. Run it locally
  the same way: `python3 scripts/check-control-chars.py`.
- **Rust toolchain is pinned to 1.88** (`api/rust-toolchain.toml`) because some
  transitive deps ship edition2024 crates. The host default may be older — always
  use `cargo +1.88`.
- **sqlx uses runtime queries** (`query_as::<_, T>`), not the compile-time macros,
  so the crate builds without a live DB. Keep it that way.
- **Claude must run as non-root** for `bypassPermissions`; both exec sites set
  `user: "codespace"`. Don't remove that.
- **Hard reset** (`POST /api/v1/agent/reset`, `orchestrator::hard_reset`) wipes
  history + the Claude session and requeues the in-progress task for a clean-slate
  restart. It bumps an in-memory `AppState::reset_epoch`; a turn snapshots that
  epoch at its start and abandons its post-turn handling (session persist, task
  move) if it changed, so a reset landing mid-turn is never undone by the turn it
  interrupted. Keep that guard if you touch the turn-completion path.
- **Per-task hard reset** (`POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/reset`, `orchestrator::reset_task`,
  task page button) abandons one stuck task's attempt and starts it over: if the
  agent is *actively* mid-turn on it (`in_progress` + `working`/`preparing`, unique
  because the loop is single-threaded) it bumps `reset_epoch`, kills the Claude
  process (`kill_agent_process`), and clears the shared session; then best-effort
  closes the PR, deletes the branch (remote via `git::delete_remote_branch` + the
  workspace clone), reopens a closed source issue, and returns the card to
  **Available** (`queries::reset_task`, clearing branch/PR/error/session). Unlike
  the global reset it leaves other tasks, the session (when not interrupting), and
  history untouched. Returns a `ResetSummary` of what ran.
- **stream-json schema can drift** across Claude Code versions; the parser keeps
  unknown shapes as `Other` rather than failing. Verify against the installed
  version when touching `claude/events.rs`.
- **Follow the global engineering conventions** (human readability first; read the
  applicable `~/.claude/docs/*.md` before editing Rust/Docker/TS/etc.).
- **Git:** branch is `v3.0.0`; remote is `JalapenoLabs/Seraphim`. Commit + push
  only when asked. **Never** add a co-author trailer. **No em dashes** in any
  user-facing text (commits, PRs, UI).

## Status / not yet done (phase 2)

- **Real end-to-end run is unproven** — a full Claude turn → PR → auto-merge needs
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` + `GH_TOKEN` set. SSH cloning of a real private repo
  (`yearloom`) is already verified.
- **Jira source (now first-class, issue #290)** — `api/src/jira/` (migration
  `0016`): a dual-mode (Cloud + Server/DC) client, connection config + secret token
  on the `settings` row, followed `jira_boards` with a status->column map and a repo
  set, board auto-discovery, and ticket sync into tasks. A Jira ticket is now
  **auto-pulled and worked exactly like a GitHub issue**: it inherits its board's
  repo set as default target repos (seeded on first sync, operator-overridable on
  the card via the same set-repo path internal tickets use, never clobbered by a
  later sync), `pick_next_todo` pulls any Jira ticket with a target repo, the prompt
  renders the Jira key + summary + description + link, and the same branch -> PR ->
  review-gate -> merge flow runs (multi-repo: a PR per target repo, all-merge-to-
  Done via `task_pull_requests`). A repo-less Jira ticket stays on the board,
  skipped, until a repo is assigned; since that skip is otherwise silent, both the
  board card and the task view flag it (issue #337): the card shows an amber "No
  target repo" warning label and the task's Target repositories section shows a
  warning banner. Both are pure frontend derivations of `source_kind === 'jira'`
  with an empty `target_repo_ids`, so nothing new is stored. On PR open and on Done the agent posts a
  comment back to the Jira issue (PR link(s) + outcome) via `JiraClient::add_comment`,
  and the agent-driven move to Done transitions the ticket through the board's
  column->status map (`orchestrator::transition_jira_to_column`, shared with the
  manual board-move path). The task page's conversation view also renders a Jira
  ticket's discussion (issue #294): `GET /tasks/:id/issue` reads the issue +
  comments from the Jira REST API (`JiraClient::fetch_thread`) into the same
  `IssueThread` shape GitHub/internal use, and a reply posts back to Jira via the
  existing `add_comment` path. The thread shows the workflow status verbatim (Jira
  has no open/closed binary) and offers only the comment box (status is changed by
  moving the card on the board, not from the thread). **Not yet:** assignee
  write-back.
- **MooreslabAI human-review commenting** — `GitHubSource::comment` exists but is
  unused (`#[expect(dead_code)]`).
- **Usage-limit rotation + auto-pause** — when `usage_limit_pause_enabled`, a Claude
  `rate_limit_event` that crosses `usage_limit_threshold` (or a rejected/exhausted
  window; pure decision in `orchestrator::usage::pause_until`) marks the **active
  credential** `exhausted_until` the window reset and rotates to the next credential
  by priority (issue #341, `orchestrator::credentials::mark_exhausted_and_reconcile`).
  Only when EVERY credential is exhausted does `reconcile_pause` set
  `settings.usage_paused_until` to the soonest reset, and `next_actionable_task`
  holds all new work until then, then auto-clears it. Escape hatches (issue #292):
  `POST /settings/usage/resume` clears the pause now (the board banner and the
  Settings usage section each have a "Resume now" button), and every settings
  update runs `orchestrator::reevaluate_usage_pause`, which lifts an active pause
  when the toggle is turned off or the threshold is raised above the latest known
  utilization (`usage::should_lift_pause`, re-judging the latest `rate_limit`
  event). A genuinely exhausted window still stands until reset.

## Railways (planned)

> Locked design from the scoping session. Tracked by the **Railways** GitHub
> milestone. The Conductor (automated ops agent) is explicitly out of scope for now.

A **railway** is a named parallel agent lane: its own workspace container, agent
loop, Claude session, and a set of repos. A repo belongs to **exactly one** railway
for work, so a task's railway always follows its repo. An undeletable **`main`**
railway holds everything by default.

- **Board:** swimlanes. One board, each railway a horizontal lane across the
  columns. Moving a card to another railway is a repo-reassign action, not a drag.
- **Management UI:** a Settings subpage (`/settings/railways`, issue #344). It owns
  lane create/rename/describe, the per-railway pause + the global master pause,
  start/stop, delete-with-confirm, the idle-stop timeout, and the per-repo lane
  assignment. The board keeps the swimlanes; the global operator notepad lives on
  the kanban board, not in settings.
- **Loops:** one **agent loop per railway** (parallel); sync, review, and
  defibrillator stay single global loops that are railway-aware.
- **Container lifecycle:** lazy start on first work; auto idle-STOP (stopped, not
  removed, so restart is fast and keeps the clones plus session).
- **Repo reassignment:** railway follows repo; blocked only while a live turn runs
  on that repo's current railway, otherwise the repo and all its tasks move.
- **Per-railway:** session, pause, name, description, repo set, lifecycle state.
  **Global:** model, setup scripts, config repo, instructions, tokens, one
  schedule, branch template, review policy, plus the global **notepad**
  (operator scratchpad on the kanban board, never injected into an agent).
- **Deletion:** `main` is undeletable; deleting another railway auto-reassigns its
  repos (and their non-active tasks) to `main`, then tears down its container and
  session. Blocked while a live turn runs on it.
- **Stats:** the subscription usage gauge is global (one shared subscription) with
  an aggregate cost/tokens/time rollup; context %, cost, tokens, and time are
  per-railway, shown on each swimlane.
- **Pause:** a global master pause plus a per-railway pause; both gate work.
- **Schedule:** one global schedule for all railways.
- **Migration:** the existing setup becomes the `main` railway;
  `current_session_id` becomes main's session; all existing repos and tasks move
  to `main`; new and imported repos default to `main`.
- **Banners:** heart-attack and notification banners stay global, tagged with the
  railway they belong to.
- **Route planner (#181):** included in the milestone. The planner assigns each
  drafted issue to a railway and orders them, then bulk-create routes them to the
  right lane.
